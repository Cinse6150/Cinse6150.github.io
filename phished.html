				<h1>YOU'VE BEEN PHISHED!</h1>
				<p>This site has been designed as part of a phishing exercise for {{ client.company_name }}. If you are seeing this page, you have failed the assessment and we recommend changing your password now.</p>

				<h3>So How Can You Distinguish Between a Real Site and a Fake One?</h3>
				<p>As phising attacks get more complicated, it's imparative to be able to recognize legitimate websites.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Take a look at the email address. Check the domain. If it didn't come from {{ client.company_name }}'s real domain (i.e. the one at the end of your email address), then it may not be legitimate. </li>
					<li>Next, look at the link you just clicked to get to this site. Hover over the link. Does it look funny? Is it going to the same place as it says it is? When using HTML code, one can say a link can go to "<span style="font-style:italic">google.com</span>", but in the code, the link will be "<span style="font-style:italic">google.org?2093492834</span>". This is the number one way to identify a phishing email. <strong>Remember: Hover before you click!</strong></li>
					<li>Now, let's look at the page. Go ahead and google the company this site is posing as. SurveyHound doesn't exist. It's a fake company, and though it took a little effort to design this website, it ultimately took less than a week to design, and only cost around $10 to buy the domain and link it to the site. Attackers do this all of the time, so <strong>if you've never heard of the company before, don't be afraid to google it</strong>. A site used for phishing generally won't come up in the results, and if it does, visit the site and make sure everything looks the same.</li>
					<li>Let's look at what the site's wanting you to do. This site's asking for your credentials to verify your employment. This type of attack is common to gain user credentials and use them to log into other sites owned by your company such as email or your VPN client. <strong>Always be mindful of where you're typing in your credentials</strong></li>
				</ul>


				<h3>Now, What Do You Do If You Suspect You've Been Phished?</h3>
				<p>Simple, use the "Print Screen" key on your keyboard, open up Paint and paste the picture in there. Save it and send it to whatever email your company's policies have designated for these types of attacks. If you've fell for the email, don't be embarrassed; it happens to everyone once in a while. Change your password right away and remind yourself of what to look for so you don't fall for it next time. Make sure you report it to the appropriate people and let them know you've fell for the phish and the actions you took afterwards. <strong>Even if the email comes back legitimate, it's better safe than sorry. One compromised user could lead to a full compromise of the company.</strong></p>
